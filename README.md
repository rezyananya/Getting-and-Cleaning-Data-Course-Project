# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
In this course I have performed the below steps to create final TidyData text file:

1. I have download the dataset from the mentioned link on my machine.
2. After that I have loaded the activity files, subject files and feature files for further exectuion of my code.
3. I have merged the subject and activity data set to create one data set.
3. Also, I have loaded both the training and test datasets, and kept those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
4. I have provided descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
5. I have labeled the data set with their full descriptive variable names.
6. And finaly created tidydata of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
